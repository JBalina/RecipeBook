		<h2>Fig Newtons</h2>

		<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
		<h4>Cookie Dough:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>1/2 cup Salted butter, softened</li>
			<li>1/4 cup Brown sugar, packed</li>
			<li>1 Egg</li>
			<li>1 tsp Vanilla extract</li>
			<li>1 tsp Orange zest</li>
			<li>1 cup All-purpose flour</li>
			<li>3/4 cup Whole wheat flour</li>
			<li>1/2 tsp Baking powder</li>
			<li>1/4 tsp Salt</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Fig Jam Filling:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>1 lb Fresh figs, stems removed and quartered</li>
			<li>1 tbsp Orange juice</li>
			<li>1/2 cup Sugar</li>
			<li>1/8 tsp Cinnamon</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Instructions:</h3>
		<h4>Cookie Dough:</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg, vanilla extract, and orange zest until well combined.</li>
			<li>Add the flours, baking powder, and salt. Mix until a soft cookie dough forms. With your hands, shape the dough into a ball. Wrap the ball in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, 1 hour.</li>
		</ol>
		<h4>Fig Jam Filling:</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Heat everything together in a saucepan over medium-low or low heat, stirring often, until the figs are soft, about 30 minutes. Then transfer the mixture to a blender or food processor and blend until smooth.</li>
			<li>Transfer the jam back to the saucepan and heat over low of 20-25 mintues, stirring constantly, until very thick. The finished jam should be so thick that it holds soft peaks.</li>
		</ol>
		<h4>Combining:</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit and line a baking tray with parchment paper.</li>
			<li>On a floured surface, roll the chilled dough into a 10 inch x 14 inch rectangle. Use a knife or pizza cutter to make the outer edges even.</li>
			<li>Cut the dough into three strips of roughtly 3.5 inches wide. Divide the fig filling paste between each strip of dough, forming it into a 1 inch wide line down the center of each strip.
			<li>Carefully fold each edge of dough over the top of the fig paste, making a log. Press gently on the seam to seal the dough slightly.</li>
			<li>Place the logs seam side down onto your linked baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake the cookies for 17-20 minutes, until the logs feel dry and slightly firm when touched.</li>
			<li>Remove the cookies from oven and cut each log into 8-9 cookies while they are still warm. While still warm, place the cut cookies into an airtight container. This will soften the cookies as they cool.</li>

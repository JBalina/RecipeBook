		<img src="hongShaoRou.jpg" class="finishedImg">
		<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
		<h4>Blanching:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>2 lb Pork belly, cubed</li>
			<li>2 Scallions, cut into 2 inch pieces</li>
			<li>1/2 inch Ginger, sliced</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Braising:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>2 tbsp Canola oil</li>
			<li>3 tbsp Sugar</li>
			<li>1/3 cup Shaoxing wine</li>
			<li>2 cups Blanching liquid</li>
			<li>3 tbsp Light soy sauce</li>
			<li>1 1/2 tbsp Dark soy sauce</li>
			<li>1 inch Ginger, sliced</li>
			<li>3 Scallions, cut into 2 inch pieces</li>
			<li>2 whole Star anise</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Instructions:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>In a medium-sized pot add the blanching ingredients and enough water to cover them completely. Bring to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, cook for 5 minutes, occasionally skimming off the scum.</li>
			<li>Remove the pot from heat. Strain the pork from the pot and rinse under cold water to stop the cooking. Reserve 2 cups of the blanching liquid.</li>
			<li>In a wok, add the oil and sugar. Heat over low heat until the sugar melts and becomes a light amber color.</li>
			<li>Once the sugar is a light amber color, add in the pork. Turn the heat up to medium-low and brown the pork, about 1-2 minutes.</li>
			<li>Add the Shaoxing wine and scrape and release any brown bits from the bottom of the pan with a spatula. Add the reserved blanching liquid, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, ginger, green onions, and star anise.</li>
			<li>Bring the wok to a boil over high heat and then reduce to low and simmer. Partly cover the wok. Simmer for about 1 hour and 30 minutes. Stir 2 to 3 times throughout the simmering.</li>
			<li>If the sauce has not reduced to a glaze by this point, raise the heat to medium and stir-fry until the sauce has reduced as desired.</li>
			<li>Serve over rice with a scoop of the glaze.</li>

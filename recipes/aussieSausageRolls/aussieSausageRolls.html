		<h2>Aussie Sausage Rolls</h2>
		<img src="aussieSausageRolls.jpg" class="finishedImg">
		<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
		<h4>Meat Filling:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>1 lb Pork sausage meat, preferably Jimmy Dean's or similar</li>
			<li>3/4 cup Italian bread crumbs</li>
			<li>1/3 cup Milk</li>
			<li>1 large clove Garlic, minced</li>
			<li>1/2 tsp Paprika + more to garnish</li>
			<li>Salt, to taste</li>
			<li>Pepper, to taste</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Sausage Rolls;</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>1 lb Puff pastry (2 square sheets)</li>
			<li>1 Egg + 1 tbsp Water, whisked together for egg wash</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Instructions:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Preheat an oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
			<li>Combine all the filling ingredients together until homogenous.</li>
			<li>Unfold the pastry sheets onto a lightly floured surface. Divide each sheet into 2 so that you have 4 rectangles. Divide the filling into 4 even logs and place onto the center of each rectangle so that there is excess puff pastry to each side of the filling. Fold over one side pastry sheet over the filling. Then apply egg wash to the other side of the puff pastry before folding it over the puff pastry as well. Roll the sausage rolls over so that they are seam-side down. Cut each log into 4 even pieces and the place onto a parchment paper lined baking sheet.</li>
			<li>Brush the sausage rolls with egg wash and then sprinkle with paprika. Place into the oven and bake at 425 for about 5 minutes. Then reduce the heat to 350 and bake for another 30-35 minutes, or until golden. Check part-way through baking if there is excess oil on the pan and drain if needed.</li>
			<li>Transfer to some paper towels before transferring to a serving plate. Serve hot with some ketchup.</li>

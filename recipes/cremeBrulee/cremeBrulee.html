		<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>2 cups Heavy cream</li>
			<li>1/8 tsp Salt</li>
			<li>5 Egg yolks</li>
			<li>1/2 cup Sugar + more as needed</li>
			<li>1 tsp Vanilla extract</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Instructions:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Preheat an oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit. Bring a pot of water to a boil.</li>
			<li>Add the cream and salt to a saucepan over medium-low heat. As it heats up, add the egg yolks and sugar to a bowl and whisk to combine. Whisk in some of the hot cream to temper the yolks. Then whisk the yolks into the rest of the cream. Remove from the heat.</li>
			<li>Pour the mixture evenly into 4 6 oz ramekins. Place into a baking dish and then fill the baking dish with boiling water just halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Carefully place into the oven and let bake for 30-40 minutes, or until just barely set.</li>
			<li>Transfer to the fridge and let chill overnight or up to 3 days.</li>
			<li>When ready to serve, place about 1 tsp each of sugar onto the tops of each ramekin in a thin even layer. Either use a torch to torch the tops until the sugar melts and browns, or place into a broiler for up to 5 minutes for a similar effect. Serve immediately.</li>

		<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>1 1/2 lb Stewing Beef or Lamb, 2 inch cubes</li>
			<li>Salt, to taste</li>
			<li>3 tbsp Canola oil</li>
			<li>2 Onions, diced</li>
			<li>1 15 oz can Red kidney beans, rinsed</li>
			<li>1 tsp Turmeric</li>
			<li>1/2 tsp Black pepper</li>
			<li>4 whole Limoo amani</li>
			<li>5 cups Water, or as needed</li>
			<li>3 cups Scallion greens, about 3 bunches</li>
			<li>3 cups Parsley, about 3 bunches</li>
			<li>2 cups Cilantro, about 2 bunches</li>
			<li>3 tbsp Canola oil</li>
			<li>1-2 tbsp Dried fenugreek</li>
			<li>Crushed limoo amani, to taste</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Instructions:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Season the meat with salt to taste. Add the oil to a large pot and place over medium-high heat. Sear the meat on all sides, about 2 minutes per side or roughly 10 minutes per batch. Then remove the meat from the pot and reserve.</li>
			<li>Add in the onions and sauté until golden brown, about 7-10 minutes. Then add back in the meat along with the turmeric, pepper, and limoo amani. Sauté for just about 1 minute or until fragrant. Then add in the water. Bring to a boil and then reduce the heat to medium-low. Partially cover and let cook for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.</li>
			<li>Meanwhile, for the scallions, cilantro, and parsley, finely slice all of them by hand or place them all into a food processor and pulse until very fine.</li>
			<li>Heat the oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the herbs and sauté for 8-10 minutes, or until bright green and starting to wilt. Then season with salt to taste and add in the fenugreek. Sauté another 8-10 minutes, or until the herbs are darkened and mostly dried out.</li>
			<li>Once the stew has cooked for 1 hour, stir in the herbs. Season lightly with more salt to taste. Let cook for another 2-2 1/2 hours, partially covered, stirring ocassionally. Add more water as needed if it becomes too thick.</li>
			<li>For the last 10 minutes of cooking, stir in the beans.</li>
			<li>Taste and add salt and crushed limoo amani as needed. Serve hot over <a href="../persianSteamedRiceTahDig/persianSteamedRiceTahDig.html">Persian steamed rice</a>.</li>

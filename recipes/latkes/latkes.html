		<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>1 1/2 lb Russet potatoes</li>
			<li>1/2 medium White onion</li>
			<li>1 Egg</li>
			<li>2 tbsp Matzo meal</li>
			<li>1 tsp Kosher salt</li>
			<li>1/8 tsp Black pepper</li>
			<li>Chicken schmaltz or substitute Canola oil for frying</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Instructions:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Scrub and clean the potatoes. Do not peel. Cut in half crosswise.</li>
			<li>Grate the potatoes and onion in a food processor. Place the grated potatoes and onion into a triple layered cheesecloth and squeeze out as much liquid as possible into a bowl.</li>
			<li>Let the potato water settle for a few minutes for the starch and water to separate. Then carefully pour out the water and leave the starch.</li>
			<li>Combine the potatoes and onions with all the other ingredients except the oil/schmaltz into the starch bowl. Toss to combine until homogenous. Let rest for 10 minutes.</li>
			<li>Heat 1/4 inch of the schmaltz/oil in a pan over medium heat. Scoop 1/4 cups of the latke mixture and form into patties. Place onto the pan and cook for 4-5 minutes on each side. Then remove and place onto a paper towel lined plate. Repeat until the latke mixture is finished.</li>

		</ul>
		<h4>Beef Patties:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>1 lb Ground beef, 20% fat</li>
			<li>2 tbsp Canola oil</li>
			<li>1 small Onion, diced</li>
			<li>6 cloves Garlic, minced</li>
			<li>Optional: 1 inch Ginger, finely minced</li>
			<li>1 Scoth bonnet, stemmed, minced</li>
			<li>1 tbsp Allspice</li>
			<li>1 1/2 tsp Black pepper</li>
			<li>1/2 tsp Paprika</li>
			<li>2 cups Low sodium beef broth</li>
			<li>1/2~ tsp Salt, to tast</li>
			<li>4 Scallions, minced</li>
			<li>1 tbsp Fresh thyme</li>
			<li>1 Egg + 2 tbsp Water</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Instructions:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Place the flour, turmeric, and salt into a large food processor and pulse until homogenous. Then add in the butter and pulse again until well mixed.</li>
			<li>In a bowl, whisk together the egg, vinegar, and ice water. Then add it into the food processor and do small pulses until it all combines together into a smooth ball of dough. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and place into the fridge to chill for at least 1 hour.</li>
			<li>Heat the oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the beef and break it into small pieces with a wooden spoon. Sauté until cooked through, about 5 minutes. Then transfer the beef to a separate plate, reserving the leftover fat in the pan.</li>
			<li>Add the onion, garlic, ginger, and scotch bonnet into the pan and sauté over medium heat until softened, about 3 minutes. Then add the allspice, paprika, and black pepper and sauté until fragrant, 30-60 seconds. Add in the cooked beef and the beef broth and reduce the heat to a simmer. Let cook, stirring occasionally, until the broth has reduced by about half, about 5-10 minutes.</li>
			<li>Taste the beef and add salt as needed. Then remove from heat and stir in the scallions and thyme.</li>
			<li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
			<li>Lightly flour a flat workspace. Roll out the dough into about a 20x14 inch rectangle. Then divide and cut the dough into about 8 5x7 inch rectangles.</li>
			<li>Fill a rectangle of dough with some beef, leaving a 1/2 inch border. Brush the edges of the rectangle with some water. Then fold over the rectangle and use a fork to press down on the edges and seal the patty. Repeat for all the patties.</li>
			<li>Place the patties onto a parchment paper lined baking sheet. Whisk together the egg and 2 tablespoons water to make an egg wash. Brush the surface of each of the patties with egg wash. Transfer to the oven and bake for 20-25 minutes or until completely cooked through.</li>
			<li>Let cool 5 minutes before serving. Serve hot.</li>

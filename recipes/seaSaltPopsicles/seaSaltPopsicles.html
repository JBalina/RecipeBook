		<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>1 1/2 cups Milk</li>
			<li>1 1/2 cups Heavy cream</li>
			<li>3 tbsp Cornstarch</li>
			<li>3/4 cup Sugar</li>
			<li>1 tsp Salt, or to taste</li>
			<li>3-5 drops Teal food coloring</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Instructions:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Place 1/2 cup each of the milk and heavy cream into a bowl and whisk together with the cornstarch.</li>
			<li>Pour the rest of the milk and heavy cream into a pot and bring to a simmer over medium-low heat. As it comes to a simmer, whisk in the sugar. Then, pour the cornstarch milk into the heating pot while whisking constantly until it thickens, about 1 minute.</li>
			<li>Whisk in the salt and then remove from heat. Strain the mixture into a heat proof bowl and then whisk in the food coloring. Cover and transfer to the fridge to chill completely.</li>
			<li>Once chilled, pour into an already churning ice cream maker. Let churn for 25 minutes. Once a soft serve consistency, transfer into popsicle molds using a piping bag. Transfer to a freezer to firm up overnight. Serve frozen.</li>

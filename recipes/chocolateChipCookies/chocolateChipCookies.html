		<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>1 cup Butter, softened</li>
			<li>200 g Sugar</li>
			<li>220 g Light brown sugar</li>
			<li>2 tsp Vanilla extract</li>
			<li>2 large Eggs</li>
			<li>360 g Flour</li>
			<li>1 tsp Baking soda</li>
			<li>1/2 tsp Baking powder</li>
			<li>1 tsp Fine sea salt, or to taste</li>
			<li>350g Chocolate chips</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Instructions:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Line a two baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
			<li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the butter, sugar, and light brown sugar with an electric hand mixer. Then cream in the eggs and vanilla extract.</li>
			<li>In a separate bowl combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt with a whisk. Then fold in the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients with a rubber spatula. Mix the ingredients until completely homogenous. Then gently fold in the chocolate chips.</li>
			<li>Form the cookie dough into balls about 2-3 tablespoons each and place onto the baking sheet. Place only about 6 cookies, evenly spaced, per sheet in order to not have them touch after baking. Bake for 8-10 minutes, or until just barely starting to brown on the edges. Then let the cookies rest in the pan for at least 2 minutes before removing. Repeat until all the dough is finished. Serve warm or room temperature with milk.</li>

		<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>1 1/2 lb Taro, small variety, not peeled or cut</li>
			<li>Water, as needed</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Instructions:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Bring a pot of water to a boil. Then add in the taro, making sure that they are submerged. Let boil, covered, for 15-20 minutes or until fork tender.</li>
			<li>Remove the taro from the pot and peel. Place the taro into a stand mixer with the paddle attachment. Run the stand mixer on the lowest setting until it is completely mashed. Then raise to medium/high speed to remove most of the lumps.</li>
			<li>Once most of the lumps have been removed, set the mixer to medium and begin to slowly incorporate water into the mix. Add 1-2 tbsp water at a time and wait until fully incorporated before adding more. Continue to add water until the poi reaches a desired preference, preferably a two finger poi consistency.</li>
			<li>Serve at room temperature.</li>

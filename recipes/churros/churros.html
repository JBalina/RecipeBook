			<li>Combine the cinnamon sugar mixture and place into a shallow bowl.</li>
			<li>Add the water, butter, sugar, vanilla extract, and salt to a pot. Mix and bring to a boil. Once it comes to a boil, remove from heat and mix in the flour with a wooden spoon until the mixture is smooth.</li>
			<li>While the mixture cools down for a couple of minutes, place 1 1/2 inches of oil into a pot and heat to about 330 degrees.</li>
			<li>While waiting for the oil to heat, mix in the eggs to the mixture one at a time until the mixture is very smooth. Transfer the mixture to a piping bag with a large closed star piping tip, making sure there are no air bubbles.</li>
			<li>Working in small batches, pipe 6 inch pieces of the dough into oil. Cook for 2-4 minutes on each side or until golden.</li>
			<li>Remove the churro from the oil and place onto a paper towel lined plate for about 30 seconds. Then coat the churro in the cinnamon sugar before placing into a serving bowl. Serve on its own or with hot <a href="../champurrado/champurrado.html">Champurrado</a>.</li>

		<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>1 gallon Milk, preferably unpasteurized</li>
			<li>1/2 cup White vinegar or Lemon juice</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Instructions:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Add the milk to a large pot and heat over medium/medium-low heat. Stir often to prevent scorching. Bring to a near boil, about 190 degrees Fahrenheit. Takes about 30-40 minutes.</li>
			<li>Once 190 degrees Fahrenheit, remove from heat and gently stir in the vinegar. Stir for about 1 minute to let completely curdle. Then let cool to room temperature.</li>
			<li>Pour into a cheesecloth or nut milk bag to strain out the whey. Squeeze to remove as much whey as possible. Place the cheesecloth onto a colander over a large bowl and weigh down with a heavy object. Transfer to a fridge and let rest for 3-4 hours.</li>
			<li>Remove from the cheesecloth and wrap with plastic wrap. Return to the fridge to store.</li>

			<li>1 tbsp (25 g) Hawaiian salt</li>
			<li>1 tbsp Liquid smoke, Mesquite or Hickory</li>

		<h3>Instructions:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Pierce the pork all over with a fork. Then rub all over with the liquid smoke and then with the salt. Less traditionally, you can add garlic by sticking them into holes around the pork.</li>
			<li>Wrap the pork with the banana leaf and place into the slow cooker seam-side down. Let cook on low for 8-12 hours, checking every hour after the 8 hour mark.</li>
			<li>Remove from the slow cooker and from the banana leaf. Shred the pork and reserve 1 cup of the liquid.</li>
			<li>For kalua pig and cabbage, add the cabbage to a large pan with the pork and 1 cup of the liquid. Cover and bring to a boil. Then remove the cover and cook on medium for about 5 minutes or until the cabbage is cooked to preference.</li>
			<li>Serve hot. Optionally with <a href="../poi/poi.html">poi</a>.</li>

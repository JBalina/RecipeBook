		<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>1 cup Frozen grated ube</li>
			<li>1 cup Milk</li>
			<li>1 cup Heavy cream</li>
			<li>1/2 cup Sugar</li>
			<li>5 Eggs yolks</li>
			<li>1 tsp Vanilla Extract</li>
			<li>1/2 tsp Ube extract</li>
			<li>Optional: Macapuno or Shredded cheese</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Instructions:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Place the milk and heavy cream in a pot over medium-low to medium heat. Heat to below scalding/smoking.</li>
			<li>While the milk heats, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar in a bowl. Pour 1/4 of the milk into the eggs while whisking constantly. Add more milk if desired. Then pour the egg mixture into the pot with the rest of the milk while whisking constantly.</li>
			<li>Heat the milk mixture slowly while whisking until the temperature reads 170 degrees Fahrenheit. Then remove from the heat immediately.</li>
			<li>Mix in the grated ube, vanilla extract, and ube extract. Blend together with an immersion blender until homogenous. Transfer to a bowl and let chill in the fridge completely.</li>
			<li>When chilled completely, turn on the ice cream maker and pour in the mixture. Let churn until soft serve consistency, about 30-40 minutes. Add in optional add-ins a couple minutes before done churning. Transfer to a sealable container and let chill in freezer until firm.</li>

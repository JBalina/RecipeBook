		<h2>Chicken Groundnut Stew</h2>
		<img src="chickenGroundnutStew.jpg" class="finishedImg">
		<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>2-3 lb Chicken thighs or legs, bone-in and skin-on</li>
			<li>3 tbsp Vegetable oil</li>
			<li>1 large Yellow onion, sliced</li>
			<li>3 inches Ginger, minced</li>
			<li>6-8 cloves Garlic, minced</li>
			<li>2-3 lb Sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into large chunks</li>
			<li>1 15 oz can Diced tomatoes, Crushed tomatoes, or Tomato sauce</li>
			<li>32 oz Chicken Stock</li>
			<li>1 cup Peanut butter</li>
			<li>1 cup Roasted peanuts</li>
			<li>1 tbsp Ground coriander</li>
			<li>1 tsp Cayenne pepper, or more to preference</li>
			<li>Salt, to taste</li>
			<li>Black pepper, to taste</li>
			<li>1/4 - 1/2 cup Cilantro, chopped</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Instructions:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Salt the chicken pieces well and pat them dry. Heat the vegetable oil in a large soup pot set over medium-high heat and brown the chicken in the oil. Do this in batches to not crowd the pot. Set the chicken pieces aside as they brown.</li>
			<li>In the same pot, sauté the onions in the oil for 3-4 minutes, stirring often and scraping any browned bits off the bottom of the pot. Add the ginger and garlic and sauté another 1-2 minutes. Then add the sweet potatoes and stir well to combine.</li>
			<li>Add the chicken broth, tomatoes, peanut butter, peanuts, coriander and cayenne and stir well to combine. Add the chicken. Bring to a simmer and taste for salt, adding more if needed.</li>
			<li>Cover the pot and simmer gently for 60 minutes, or until the chicken meat easily falls off the bone and the sweet potatoes are tender.</li>
			<li>Remove the chicken pieces and set them in a bowl to cool, until cool enough to touch. Shred the meat off the bones and put the meat back in the pot. Optionally, remove and discard the skin if desired. Otherwise, chop it and put it back into the pot.</li>
			<li>Adjust the seasonings for salt and cayenne, then very heavily season with black pepper. The stew should be peppery. Stir in the cilantro and serve by itself, or with simple steamed rice.</li>

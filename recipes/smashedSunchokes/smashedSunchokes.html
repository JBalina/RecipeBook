		<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>1 lb Sunchokes</li>
			<li>Salt, to taste</li>
			<li>1 1/2 tbsp Canola oil</li>
			<li>2 tbsp Butter</li>
			<li>1/2 tsp Fresh thyme</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Instructions:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Add the sunchokes to a pot with enough cold water to cover. Season with salt and then bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and let cook for about 10 minutes or until fork tender.</li>
			<li>Strain the sunchokes from the water and let cool. Use a large pot or skillet to flatten the sunchokes one at a time. Do not place so much pressure that it separates and falls apart.</li>
			<li>Heat the oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the sunchokes in a single layer and cook without moving for about 3 minutes or until well browned. Then flip and add in the butter and thyme. Let cook for another 3 minutes while often scooping butter from the pan over the sunchokes.</li>
			<li>Transfer to a serving plate and serve hot with a garnish of flakey salt, more thyme, and some of the remaining fat from the pan.</li>

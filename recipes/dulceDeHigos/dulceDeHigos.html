		<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>2 lb Figs</li>
			<li>1 1/2 lb Panela</li>
			<li>1/8 tsp Baking soda</li>
			<li>2 Cloves</li>
			<li>1 stick Cinnamon</li>
			<li>5 cups Water + more as needed</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Instructions:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Cut a small "X" on the top of each fig. Place into a large bowl with water to cover and let sit in the fridge overnight.</li>
			<li>The next day, drain the figs from the water. Place into a pot with new water to cover and mix in the baking soda. Bring to a boil over medium heat and let cook until softened, about 15-20 minutes.</li>
			<li>Strain out the water and discard. Set aside the figs. Add the 5 cups of water, cloves, cinnamon, and the panela to the pot. Heat over low heat until the sugar is completely dissolved.</li>
			<li>Add the figs back to the pot. Continue to cook over low heat for at least 3 hours, stirring occasionally, or until the syrup has reduced to preference.</li>
			<li>Remove from the heat and optionally can in jars. Serve warm or cold with some fresh cheese like queso fresco, mozzarella, or farmer's cheese.</li>

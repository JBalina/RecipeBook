		<img src="bisonWasna.jpg" class="finishedImg">
		<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>2 lb Lean bison such as flank, rump, or round, fat trimmed off and sliced thinly against the grain</li>
			<li>1/2 cup Dried berries, preferably Dried cranberries</li>
			<li>Optional: 1-2 tsp Crushed dried juniper berries, or to taste</li>
			<li>1/8 tsp Smoked salt, or to taste</li>
			<li>Bison tallow or Beef tallow, as needed, melted</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Instructions:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Place the bison into a dehydrator. Let dehydrate completely, at least 4 hours to overnight depending on the thickness of the cuts.</li>
			<li>Once completely dry, place into a food processor. Process into a coarse or fine powder to preference. Then add the berries and process to a powder as well. Add seasonings to taste. Then add just enough fat/tallow to act as a glue to hold the pemmican together. Form into bars, patties, or any desired shape.</li>
			<li>Either store or serve immediately. If dried properly, will last years unrefrigerated.</li>
		</ol>

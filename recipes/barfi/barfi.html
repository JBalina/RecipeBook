		<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>1/3 cup Ghee</li>
			<li>1 cup Milk</li>
			<li>3 cups Powdered milk</li>
			<li>3/4 cup Sugar</li>
			<li>Optional: 1/4 tsp Ground cardamom</li>
			<li>2 tbsp Almonds, chopped</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Instructions:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Heat the ghee in a large pan over low heat until the ghee is melted. Add in the milk while mixing continuously and heat until the milk starts to boil.</li>
			<li>Once the milk starts to bubble, start to mix in the milk powder. Mix in the powder in batches to prevent lumps. Stir continuously.</li>
			<li>Mix in the sugar. Stir continuously for about 10 minutes or until the mixture begins to start forming like a dough and is no longer sticking to the pan. To check if it is done, take a small piece of the mixture and give it a minute to cool. If it can easily be rolled into a ball then the mixture is ready.</li>
			<li>Add the cardamom powder, mix, and remove from heat. </li>
			<li>Transfer the mixture to a greased brownie pan. Smoothen the mixture with the back of a spoon or spatula.</li>
			<li>Sprinkle with the chopped almonds and then slightly press the almonds into the barfi.</li>
			<li>Let cool completely. Once cooled, cut into small squares and serve.</li>

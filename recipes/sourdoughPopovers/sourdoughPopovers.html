		<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>1/2 cup (113g) Sourdough starter</li>
			<li>1 cup (227g) Milk</li>
			<li>3 Eggs</li>
			<li>3/4 tsp Salt</li>
			<li>1 cup (120g) Flour</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Instructions:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Place a muffin tray into an oven and preheat to 450 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
			<li>Combine the sourdough starter, milk, eggs, and salt into large bowl. Mix with a handmixer on low. Do not whip the mixture. Then slowly mix in the flour. It should be about the consistency of heavy cream.</li>
			<li>Remove the muffin tray from the oven and carefully grease it with non-stick spray. Fill in every other muffin cup all the way with the mixture. Spacing the popovers will give them room to expand without touching.</li>
			<li>Place the muffin tray back into the oven and bake at 450 degrees Fahrenheit for 15 minutes. Then reduce the heat and cook for 15-20 more minutes, or until evenly golden. Remove from the oven and serve immediately.</li>

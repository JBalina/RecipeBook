		<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
		<h4>Dough:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>4 cups (500 g) Flour</li>
			<li>1 cup Boiling water</li>
			<li>1/4 cup Canola oil</li>
			<li>1/2 tsp Salt</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Pierogies:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>500 g Russet potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
			<li>3 tbsp Butter</li>
			<li>2 large Onions, sliced</li>
			<li>300 g <a href="../farmersCheese/farmersCheese.html">Tvorog</a>, crumbled</li>
			<li>1/2 tsp Salt, or to taste</li>
			<li>1/2 tsp Black pepper</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>To Fry:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>2 tbsp Butter, or as needed</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Instructions:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Add the potatoes to a large pot of cold, salted water. Heat over high heat and bring to a boil. Boil until tender, about 15 minutes.</li>
			<li>While the potatoes cook, heat the butter in a medium pan over medium heat. Add the onions and saut√© until caramelized, about 15-20 minutes. Then remove from heat and reserve.</li>
			<li>When the potatoes are done cooking, strain out the water from the pot. Heat the potatoes over medium heat for 1-2 minutes, stirring often, just to dry them. They are done when you can see a thin layer of residue on the bottom of the pot. Remove from the heat.</li>
			<li>Add the potatoes to a large bowl. Add the tvorog, salt, and pepper and mash until smooth. Then mix in half of the onions. Reserve the rest of the onions for garnish.</li>
			<li>For the dough, combine all of the ingredients and knead until just soft and elastic. Do not overknead.</li>
			<li>Divide the dough into managable portions. Roll out a portion of the dough to about 1/8 inch thick. Cut out circles with a 3 inch cookie cutter. Top with plastic wrap to prevent from drying out. Repeat with the rest of the dough.</li>
			<li>Take a circle of dough and place 1 tbsp of the filling mixture into it. Fold the circle in half and pinch the edges closed to seal and create a 1/2 inch border. Lightly dust the pierogi with flour and loosely cover with plastic wrap until ready to cook. Repeat with the rest of the dough and filling.</li>
			<li>Bring a large pot of salt water to a boil. Work in batches of 5-6. Swirl the water with a spoon to prevent from sticking to the pot and add the pierogies to the boiling water. Let the pierogies start to float, 1-4 minutes, and then continue to cook for another 1-2 minutes. Then strain from the water and transfer to a serving plate. Repeat with the rest of the pierogies.</li>
			<li>Optionally, after boiling you can fry the pierogies. Heat the butter in a pan over medium heat. In batches, add the pierogies and fry for about 4-5 minutes per side or until golden.</li>
			<li>Serve immediately, garnished with the remaining caramelized onions.</li>

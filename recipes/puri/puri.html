		<h2>Puri</h2>

		<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>1 cup (160 g) Fine semolina (Sooji)</li>
			<li>1/8 tsp Baking soda</li>
			<li>1/4 tsp Salt</li>
			<li>1 tsp Canola oil</li>
			<li>1 tbsp Flour</li>
			<li>6 tbsp Water</li>
			<li>Oil, for deep frying</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Instructions:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Whisk together the semolina, baking soda, and salt. Then mix in the oil with your hands.</li>
			<li>Mix in the flour and then knead in 3 tbsp of water. Knead until as smooth as possible, and then knead in 1 more tbsp water. Knead in the final 2 tbsp water until smooth. If the dough is too soft, add more semolina. If too hard, add more water.</li>
			<li>Cover and let the dough rest for 30 minutes. Then knead one more time. Meanwhile, heat some oil to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
			<li>Divide the dough into 3 pieces. Cover the dough while not using. Take some of the dough and roll it to about 1.5-2 mm thin. Cut out circles with a 2 inch cookie cutter. Fry the dough circles as they are cut out in the oil. Fry until puffed up and golden throughout. Repeat for the rest of the dough.</li>
			<li>Transfer to a paper-towel lined plate to absorb any excess oil. Use immediately.</li>

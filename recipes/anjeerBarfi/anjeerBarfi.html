		<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>3/4 cup Dried figs, chopped</li>
			<li>3/4 cup Dried dated, pitted and chopped</li>
			<li>3 tbsp Water, or as needed</li>
			<li>3/4 cup Mixed nuts: Almonds, Walnuts, Cashews, and/or Pistachios</li>
			<li>1-3 tsp Ghee</li>
			<li>1/8 tsp Cardamom powder</li>
			<li>1/8 tsp Cinnamon</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Instructions:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>In a medium pan over medium heat, dry roast the nuts until crunchy. Set aside into a separate plate and reserve.</li>
			<li>Over medium to medium-low heat, add the figs to the pan with the water. Cook until soft, adding water if needed.</li>
			<li>Reduce the heat to low and add the dates, cinnamon, and cardamom powder. Stir constantly until it becomes mushy and sticky, about 3-4 minutes. As it becomes sticky, mix in the ghee. Mash together until it becomes a thick paste and is no longer soggy.</li>
			<li>Add the nuts and mix until well combined. Remove from the pan and place into a greased brownie tray and mold it into a rectangle. Once cooled, cut it into squares and serve.</li>

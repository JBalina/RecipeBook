		<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>3/4 cup Dried figs, chopped</li>
			<li>3/4 cup Dried dated, pitted and chopped</li>
			<li>Boiling water, as needed</li>
			<li>3/4 cup Mixed nuts: Almonds, Walnuts, Cashews, and/or Pistachios</li>
			<li>1-3 tsp Ghee</li>
			<li>1/8 tsp Cardamom powder</li>
			<li>1/8 tsp Cinnamon</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Instructions:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Place the dried figs and dates into a bowl and pour over with boiling water until covered with an inch of excess water. Let soak for 3 hours.</li>
			<li>Remove the figs and dates from the water and place into a food processor. Blend until it is a smooth paste.</li>
			<li>In a medium pan over medium heat, dry roast the nuts until crunchy. Set aside into a separate plate and reserve. Optionally, separate 1/4 of the nuts to use as garnish.</li>
			<li>Heat ghee in a pan over medium heat. Add fig and date paste and cook until thick, stirring continuously.</li>
			<li>Reduce the heat to low and add the dates, cinnamon, and cardamom powder. If it sticks too much to the pan, mix in more ghee. Mix until it becomes very thick and is not soggy, 4-5 minutes.</li>
			<li>Add the nuts and mix until well combined. Remove from the pan and place into a greased brownie tray and mold it into a rectangle. Optionally, garnish with reserved nuts. Once cooled, cut it into squares and serve.</li>

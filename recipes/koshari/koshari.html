		<ul>
			<li>1 tbsp Vegetable oil</li>
			<li>1 small Onion, grated</li>
			<li>4 cloves Garlic, minced</li>
			<li>1 tsp Coriander</li>
			<li>Optional: 1/2 - 1 tsp Aleppo pepper</li>
			<li>1 28 oz can Tomato sauce</li>
			<li>Salt, to taste</li>
			<li>Black pepper, to taste</li>
			<li>1-2 tbsp White vinegar, or to taste</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Koshari:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>1 1/2 cup Brown lentils, rinsed</li>
			<li>4 cups Water</li>
			<li>1 1/2 cup Medium-grain rice, rinsed and soaked in water for 15 minutes</li>
			<li>1 tbsp Vegetable oil</li>
			<li>1/2 tsp Salt</li>
			<li>1/2 tsp Black pepper</li>
			<li>1/2 tsp Coriander</li>
			<li>2 cups Elbow pasta</li>
			<li>3 cups Water, or as needed</li>
			<li>1 15 oz can Chickpeas, rinsed and drained</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Instructions:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>For the fried onions, add the oil to a large skillet and heat over medium-high heat. Take the onion and toss with salt to taste. Then toss with flour to dredge evenly.</li>
			<li>Place the dredged onions into the hot oil and fry for about 15-20 minutes, stirring frequently, until browned and crispy.</li>
			<li>For the sauce, add the oil to a sauce pan over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté until just starting to brown, about 7 minutes. Then add in the garlic and spices and sauté for another minute.</li>
			<li>Add the tomato sauce and salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a simmer and cook, uncovered, for 15 minutes or until thickened.</li>
			<li>Taste the sauce and add salt and pepper as needed. Then stir in the vinegar. Cover and heat over low heat to just keep warm.</li>
			<li>To a separate pot, add the lentils and 4 cups water. Heat over high to bring to a boil and then reduce to a simmer over low. Parboil for just 15-17 minutes. It will finish cooking later with the rice. Then drain and season lightly with some salt.</li>
			<li>Drain the rice from its soaking water. Add the drained rice and the drained lentils to a pot along with the oil, salt, pepper, and coriander. Heat over medium-high heat and stir constantly. Cook for 3 minutes. Then add about 3 cups of water, or as needed to cover the rice and lentils. Bring to a boil and then cover and reduce the heat to low. Let cook for 20 minutes before removing from the heat and letting rest for 5 more minutes without removing the cover.</li>
			<li>Meanwhile cook the pasta. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and then add in the pasta. Let cook until al dente or to preference, about 7 minutes. Then drain from the water.</li>
			<li>For the chickpeas, place them into a bowl and microwave just to warm up.</li>
			<li>To serve, layer onto a serving plate in the order of lentils/rice, pasta, sauce, chickpeas, and then the fried onions. Serve hot immediately.</li>

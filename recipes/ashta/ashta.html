		<h2>Ashta</h2>
		<img src="ashta.jpg" class="finishedImg">
		<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>6 cups (1.36 kg) Milk</li>
			<li>3 tbsp (35 g) Lemon juice or White vinegar</li>
			<li>6 tbsp (40 g) Cornstarch</li>
			<li>3 tbsp (40 g) sugar</li>
			<li>4 1/2 tbsp (55 g) Heavy cream</li>
			<li>2 tsp Rose water AND/OR 2 tsp Orange blossom water</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Instructions:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Add 4 1/2 cups of milk to a large sauce pan over medium/medium-low heat. Slowly bring to just under a boil, about 190 degrees Fahrenheit, while stirring often to prevent scolding the milk.</li>
			<li>Then remove from the heat and slowly stir in the lemon juice/vinegar. The milk will curd.</li>
			<li>Strain the milk through a cheese cloth and squeeze out any excess liquid. Reserve.</li>
			<li>To the same saucepan, add in the remaining milk and cornstarch. Whisk until there are no lumps remaining and then whisk in the sugar and heavy cream.</li>
			<li>Heat over medium heat and whisk constantly. Heat while whisking until it thickens. Then remove from heat.</li>
			<li>Let cool to room temperature. Then agressively whisk in the milk curds and the rose water/orange blossom water. Alternatively, blend in the curds and flower water for a smoother ashta.</li>
			<li>Transfer to a fridge to set and chill completely before using. Makes about 2 cups.</li>

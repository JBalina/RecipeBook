		<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
		<h4>Kvass:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>1 lb Bread, preferably Dark rye</li>
			<li>3 quarts Boiling water, nonchlorinated</li>
			<li>2 tbsp Sourdough starter</li>
			<li>1 cup Sugar</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Optional Add-ins:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Raisins</li>
			<li>Mint</li>
			<li>Lemon rinds</li>
			<li>Apples</li>
			<li>Honey</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Instructions:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
			<li>Cube the bread and place into the oven. Bake for about 20 minutes, tossing halfway, or until very dark and almost burnt on both sides.</li>
			<li>Transfer the bread to a gallon jar. Pour the boiling water over the bread. Let sit overnight, about 12-18 hours.</li>
			<li>Strain out the bread from the liquid, squeezing out as much liquid as possible. Add more water as needed to make 3 quarts. Stir in the sugar and sourdough starter. You can add the flavor add-ins now or during the 2nd fermentation.</li>
			<li>Let ferment for at least 2 days or until it reaches a flavor you like. Then either drink right away, refrigerate, or transfer to 16 oz flip-top bottles for a 2nd fermentation.</li>
			<li>For 2nd fermentation, you can add flavorings to individual bottles if desired. For bottles without flavoring, you can add 1/2 tsp sugar to help speed up its fermentation time to keep up with the flavored bottles. Let ferment for 1-5 more days or until the kvass reaches your desired carbonation level. Then refigerate until completely chilled. Serve cold.</li>

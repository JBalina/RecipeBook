		<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>1 1/2 cup Tahini</li>
			<li>1 tsp Vanilla extract</li>
			<li>1/4 tsp Salt</li>
			<li>1 1/2 cup Sugar</li>
			<li>1/2 cup Water</li>
			<li>Optional: 1/4 cup Chopped nuts of choice</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Instructions:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Prepare a loaf pan by greasing it and lining it with parchment paper.</li>
			<li>Combine the tahini, vanilla extract, and salt into a large bowl. Mix until homogenous.</li>
			<li>Combine the sugar and water into a pot with a candy thermometer. Heat over medium heat until the thermometer reads exactly 250 degrees Fahrenheit. The immediately remove from heat and pour into the bowl with the tahini.</li>
			<li>Mix the tahini and the sugar syrup until homogenous, but make sure to avoid over mixing. When the mixture is easily separating from the sides of the bowl, that is a sign that it is starting to become overmixed. Transfer the mixture to the prepped loaf pan and allow to cool to room temperature.</li>
			<li>Once at room temperature, the halva should have hardened into a fudge like consistency. Remove from the loaf pan and slice into servable pieces.</li>

			<li>Add the sugar to the milk and mix to dissolve. If using 7 cups of milk, add the milk to a pot and bring to a boil. Reduce to about half and then transfer to a fridge to chill completely.</li>
			<li>Add the tukmaria seeds to about 1 cup of water or more to soak. Let soak for at least 20 minutes and then strain out the water.</li>
			<li>Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add the sev and let cook for about 1-3 minutes, or until cooked completely. Then strain from the water and rinse with cold water.</li>
			<li>Prepare 4 16 oz glasses. Add evenly to each glass in order: rose jelly, tukmaria seeds, sev, rose syrup, and then the milk. If there is no food coloring already present in the rose syrup, optionally add 1-2 drops of red food coloring to the bottom of each glass before adding the ingredients. Then top each with a scoop or two of the vanilla ice cream, a little more rose jelly, and some chopped pistachios. Serve chilled.</li>

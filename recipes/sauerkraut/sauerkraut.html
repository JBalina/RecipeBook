		<h2>Sauerkraut</h2>

		<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>1 Cabbage</li>
			<li>Salt, as needed</li>
			<li>Optional: 1 tbsp Caraway seeds</li>
			<li>Optional: 1 tsp Juniper berries</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Instructions:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Quarter and core the cabbage. Shred into very thin strips.</li>
			<li>Weigh the cabbage. The salt needed is exactly 2% of the weight of the cabbage.</li>
			<li>In a large bowl, add in the cabbage and salt. Aggressively massage and squeeze the salt into the cabbage. The cabbage should release a lot of liquid.</li>
			<li>Place the cabbage and its liquid into a half-gallon jar along with the caraway seeds or juniper berries. Push down heavily on the cabbage until the cabbage is completely submerged in its brine. Place plastic wrap and a weight into the jar to weigh down the cabbage, ensuring that nothing floats to the surface.</li>
			<li>Loosely seal the jar with a lid and place in a dark, room temperature location. Let ferment for about 3 weeks, checking occasionally that everything is completely submerged in the brine. Once it has the desired taste, transfer to a refrigerator. Serve raw or cooked.</li>

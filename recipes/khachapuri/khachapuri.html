		<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
		<h4>Dough:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>3 1/2 - 4 cups (420-500 g) Flour, or as needed</li>
			<li>1 cup Water</li>
			<li>1/2 cup Milk, </li>
			<li>1 tsp Dry active yeast</li>
			<li>1 tsp Salt</li>
			<li>1 tbsp Olive oil</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Filling Option 1 (More Traditional):</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>3 1/2 cups Imeruli cheese, shredded</li>
			<li>1 cup Sulguni Cheese, shredded</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Filling Option 2:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>1 1/2 cup <a href="recipes/farmersCheese/farmersCheese.html">Farmer's cheese</a>, shredded</li>
			<li>1 1/2 cup Feta cheese, shredded</li>
			<li>1 1/2 cup Mozzarella, shredded</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>To Top:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>1 Egg + 1 tbsp Water, whisked together for egg wash</li>
			<li>4 Eggs</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Instructions:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Stir together water, milk, and yeast until well combined. Let rest for 10-15 mintues or until foamy.</li>
			<li>Add the flour, salt, and water/milk mixture to a stand mixer and knead until smooth and elastic, about 15 minutes, adding flour if needed. Then add in the olive oil and knead for another minute.</li>
			<li>Grease a sealable container with olive oil and place in the dough. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.</li>
			<li>Preheat an oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit. Transfer the dough to a heavily floured work surface. Split the dough into 4 equal pieces.</li>
			<li>Take one piece of dough and flatten it into a 9 inch circle, dusting with flour as needed. Transfer to a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and top with the cheese filling. Roll in two opposite sides of the circle about 2 inches, optionally stuffing with cheese, and then pinch the corners together. Give the corner ends a gentle twist. Repeat this for all the pieces of dough and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let proof for 30 minutes.</li>
			<li>Once proofed, brush the crusts with the egg wash. Transfer to the oven to bake for 15 minutes. Then briefly remove from the oven and make a small well in the centers of the khachapuris with a spoon. Crack an egg into the center of each khachapuri and return them to the oven. Bake for about 5-6 more minutes, or until the egg is cooked to your liking.</li>
			<li>Remove the khachapuri from the oven and serve immediately. Serve hot.</li>

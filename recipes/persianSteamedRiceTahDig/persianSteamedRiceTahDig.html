		<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
		<h4>Rice:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>3 cups Basmati rice, rinsed</li>
			<li>20~ cups Water</li>
			<li>1/4 cup Salt</li>
			<li>1/8 tsp Saffron, ground</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>TahDig:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>1/2 cup Yogurt</li>
			<li>1/8 tsp Saffron, ground</li>
			<li>3 tbsp Canola oil</li>
			<li>2 tbsp Butter</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Instructions:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Add water to a 6 quart pot up to 2 inches from the top, roughly 20 cups. Add the salt and bring to a boil. Then add the rice and parboil for 7-10 minutes, or until a grain of rice is soft on the edges but still firm in the center. Then strain out the rice and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking.</li>
			<li>In a bowl, combine 1 cup of the parboiled rice, the yogurt, and the saffron. Stir to combine.</li>
			<li>Add the oil and butter to the empty pot over medium low. Preferably, use a heat diffuser under the pot for a more even tahdig. Once melted, add in the yogurt mixture in an even layer. Then pile on the rest of the parboiled rice in the center to form a mountain like shape. Sprinkle over the remaining saffron. Cover with a towel lined lid and let cook for about 45-60 minutes, or until the rice grains are soft and the tahdig is light golden brown.</li>
			<li>Flip the pot onto a platter to serve. If it sticks to the bottom of the pot, you may have to scrape it off. Serve hot.</li>
